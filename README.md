# Date Range Picker for Bootstrap

This is a fork on https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker
Amended the scrip to emit dateclick event.


This date range picker component for Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates.

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, optional time picker (for e.g. making appointments or reservations),
and styles that match the default Bootstrap 3 theme.
